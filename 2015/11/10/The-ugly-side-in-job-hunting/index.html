            <p>Recently, there is a phenomenon spreading excessively like a virus in the forum that I am regularly checking. In certain threads, when the owner shares their interview experience with other job seekers like me, the replies below are kinda hilarious – all of them are eagerly asking for the code implementation and even screenshots. Therefore, those folks who get the kindness to share become their angels. It appears interesting to me, because the fact that people leaving their email addresses and some warm short messages in the threads resembles another so-called 1024 forum. </p>
<p>But I clearly remember when I registered my account, it was said rightly that this is a serious forum that aims to help Chinese students in North America, and all discussions shall be meaningful and related to the topic. As the forum grows explosively these years, the rapid growth of user base leads to the current weird situation that dumb replies accumulate and prevail. As a conscious and well-behaved part of this community, I am aware that maybe it’s time to make some change, and things needs to be done in a more decent way. Although I haven’t got any offer yet.</p>
<p>I’m just trying to analyze what those folks are thinking of when they just leave their email address out there, like a bot, without even realizing that their replies are becoming spams. I am slowly getting sick of it, and I bet some others are, too. Now this leads to that the quality of the posts on the forum going downwards. I always got surprised when I checked somebody’s profile and found out that they were demanding some info while he had not even contributed anything yet. No response may be good for them in the long run. After all, everything has its lifecycle. A few years ago, this forum was cool, but now it’s slowly transitioning into something like mitbbs.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on? Sadge.</p>
